        <p>
          In many situations, people make decisions that affect others, and these
          other-regarding choices are shaped by their fairness preferences. At the
          same time, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into
          high-stakes decision-making, making human oversight crucial and
          normatively required.

        <p>
          This paper investigates whether individuals are willing to accept an
          other-regarding decision made by someone else, and whether they are more
          or less willing to accept a decision made by an AI system rather than a
          human. It examines whether redistributive choices are revised
          differently depending on whether they were made by a human or by AI,
          and disentangles two behavioral mechanisms: a black-box effect stemming
          from uncertainty about the AI’s decision-making process, and intrinsic
          AI aversion reflecting a fundamental reluctance to rely on algorithmic
          judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The study combines a stylized theoretical framework of redistributive
          choice revision under incomplete information with an online experiment.
          The findings offer policy-relevant insights for oversight strategies and
          regulatory frameworks—such as the EU AI Act—by identifying behavioral
          barriers to effective AI integration.

      Coordination and Leadership: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence

        <p>
          Coordination failure is an obstacle to collective efficiency in many
          economic and social settings. Leadership can mitigate this problem by
          providing a focal point through public communication, but the
          effectiveness of such communication relies on shared trust that the
          leader’s recommendations will be followed by others.
        </p>
        <p>
          As generative artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly
          accessible, leaders may delegate communication tasks to automated
          systems. Whether such delegation weakens the coordinating role of
          leadership remains an open question. We investigate this issue through
          an online experiment based on the minimum effort game with leadership,
          where leaders could send either a human-written or a ChatGPT-generated
          message and followers were informed of the message’s source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Results show that coordination outcomes do not differ across treatments:
          AI- and human-generated messages are equally effective in promoting
          coordination on the Pareto-dominant equilibrium. Beliefs about other
          players’ behavior are also unaffected by the source of the message,
          suggesting that delegation to AI does not undermine strategic
          communication or followers’ trust in successful coordination.
