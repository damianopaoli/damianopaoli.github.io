      This study investigates whether reducing compliance costs can improve tax
      compliance. We focus on the impact of automatic payment systems on tax
      evasion, with the aim of providing evidence relevant for minor indirect
      taxes, such as the vehicle tax collected by regional governments in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We design a laboratory experiment in which subjects play a Tax Evasion
      Game. Participants receive a fixed endowment and perform a real-effort task
      under time pressure, during which they can earn additional income but are
      required to pay a tax. While evasion yields a higher expected payoff than
      compliance, it entails the risk of a substantial fine if detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the treatment condition, we introduce an automatic payment option that
      allows participants to commit to paying the tax before starting the task.
      We find that reducing the non-monetary burden of compliance significantly
      increases tax compliance. Finally, we elicit individual risk preferences
      and show that they do not account for the treatment effect.
